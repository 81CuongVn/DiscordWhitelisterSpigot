# DiscordWhitelisterBot-Spigot

A simple spigot plugin which allows whitelisting through a discord text channel.

Features:
- use '!whitelist MinecraftUsername' in a valid channel to whitelist people on your minecraft server
- only select Discord roles can whitelist through the bot
- bot only listens for messages in select text channels
- logs whitelist attempts from valid roles in the console

Config file is located at: (server-root)/plugins/DiscordWhitelister - this needs a valid bot token and valid channel ids to work.
To create a Discord application and/or find your discord bot token follow this link: https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/
